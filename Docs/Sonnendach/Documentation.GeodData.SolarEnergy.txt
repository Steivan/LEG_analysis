I’ll respond directly below each of your questions:

If I multiply the sum 150.77 [kWh/m2/Jahr] obtained by adding the monthly yields (Tabelle 4: STROMERTRAG_MONAT) with the roof area of 800 [m2], I get 120'616 [kWh/Jahr] and not 139'476 [kWh/Jahr] (Tabelle 3: STROMERTRAG): Can you explain the discrepancy?
This answer can be found in the document " https://www.bfe.admin.ch/bfe/fr/home/versorgung/digitalisierung/geoinformation/geodaten/solar/solarenergie-eignung-hausdach.exturl.html/aHR0cHM6Ly9wdWJkYi5iZmUuYWRtaW4uY2gvZGUvcHVibGljYX/Rpb24vZG93bmxvYWQvODE5Ng==.html ", in chapter 6. It is mentioned that the electricity yield (Stromertrag) cannot be simply calculated using surface area and solar radiation (Einstrahlung). The documentation goes even more in details on how the calculations are made.

How reliable is the data fetched from SwissTopo and sonnendach.ch, i.e., what is the percentage of potential issues like the one detected above?
Chapter 9 of the report (same as above, “Solarpotentialanalyse für Sonnendach.ch”)  is fully dedicated to data validation. While no specific percentage is provided for geometric inaccuracies, these inconsistencies are acknowledged, and the model is actively being improved to address them.

Document "9665-sonnendach_ch_dokumentation_datenmodell_de_V1_5.pdf" :
Is this document up-to-date?
Yes.

The document explains that the 2D roofs model is derived from a 3D buildings model: How can this approach yield issues like the one identified above?
The transformation from 3D to 2D (chapter 4) involves: Flattening triangulated surfaces, Removing overlapping roof layers, Simplifying geometry to top-most visible polygons. These steps can cause loss of detail, especially in complex roof structures, leading to area miscalculations or shading errors.

Table 4: I could not fetch the attribute "MTEMP_MONAT" -> Is this attribute missing?
No, the attribute is present in the table “SOLKAT_CH_DACH_MONAT”.

I am also fetching weather-data from meteoschweiz: Can you provide a link to a document that explains in more detail how to make best use of weather data when attempting to estimate the expected production of PV sites?
I recommend checking the MeteoSwiss page “Predicting photovoltaic power with the COSMO model” (Predicting photovoltaic power with the COSMO model - MeteoSwiss). This is just a suggestion—I’m not sure what other documentation might be available. If you're looking for more detailed or alternative resources, I encourage you to contact MeteoSwiss directly via their contact form (https://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/about-us/contact/contact-form.html) ; they may be able to provide further guidance.

Sonnendach.ch does account for local topographic effects, including mountain valley shading and horizon elevation. The model uses a three-level horizon calculation  (SwissAlti3D, DOM, near-horizon) that are combined into a visibility matrix that modulates solar radiation based on azimuth and elevation angles (see BerichtSonnendachCH, section 5.1, pages 19–21). The Perez anisotropic model is used to calculate solar radiation on inclined surfaces, incorporating shading effects dynamically (BerichtSonnendachCH, section 5.4, page 24).

However, it’s important to note that this is a nationwide model, and errors or anomalies can occur. These are known and documented. When users encounter such issues, we recommend using the manual solar calculator at Kosten- und Nutzenrechner für Ihre Solaranlage to obtain more accurate results.


************************************************************************************************ 

I focused on the key fields you mentioned (a_param, b_param, c_param, monate, heizgradtage, monats_ertrag), plus context for related technical fields. 
All info is directly from the doc—no assumptions or external guesses. Here's a breakdown:

Key Parameters Explained
These parameters are part of the SOLKAT_CH_DACH_MONAT table, which links to individual roof surfaces (via DF_UID) and provides monthly values for solar potential assessment. 
The model estimates PV electricity yield and heating coverage for Swiss roofs under the Energy Strategy 2050.

a_param (A_PARAM):

Type: Float (dimensionless coefficient).
Unit: None (it's a scaling factor).
Description: Parameter a in the linear combination formula for approximating monthly radiation on the roof surface from direct (DIR) and diffuse (DIF) radiation on a horizontal surface.
Calculation Method: Used in the formula a * DIR + b * DIF + c, 
where DIR and DIF are monthly average radiation values (kWh/m²/month) from MeteoSwiss data (2011–2020). 
a weights the direct radiation component, adjusted for roof orientation, slope, and shading (from swissALTI3D and DOM datasets). 
One value per month per roof.
Context: Helps model how much direct sunlight hits the inclined roof vs. a flat surface. Values typically range from ~0.9 to ~1.5 depending on month and roof angle.


b_param (B_PARAM):

Type: Float (dimensionless coefficient).
Unit: None.
Description: Parameter b in the same linear combination formula (see a_param).
Calculation Method: Weights the diffuse radiation component in a * DIR + b * DIF + c. Derived similarly to a_param, accounting for scattering and roof geometry. 
One value per month per roof.
Context: Diffuse radiation (sky-scattered light) is less directional, so b is often close to 1 but adjusted for shading and horizon effects.


c_param (C_PARAM):

Type: Float (dimensionless coefficient).
Unit: None.
Description: Parameter c in the linear combination formula (see a_param).
Calculation Method: Constant term in a * DIR + b * DIF + c, providing an offset for model accuracy (e.g., for horizon shading or measurement errors). 
One value per month per roof.
Context: Fine-tunes the approximation for real-world losses; values can be negative to account for obstructions.


monate (MONAT):

Type: Short Integer.
Unit: None (month identifier).
Description: Calendar month indicator (1 = January, ..., 12 = December).
Calculation Method: Not calculated; it's an enumeration from the domain MONAT (Table 7 in the doc). Each roof has 12 records, one per month.
Context: Orders monthly data in the SOLKAT_CH_DACH_MONAT table for time-resolved analysis (e.g., seasonal yield).


heizgradtage (HEIZGRADTAGE):

Type: Short Integer.
Unit: Degree-days (°C-days).
Description: Monthly heating degree days, quantifying heating demand based on temperature deficits.
Calculation Method: Cumulative deviation of monthly mean temperature below a base temperature (typically 15°C or 18°C, based on Swiss standards). Derived from MeteoSwiss data (2011–2020). Formula: HDD = (Base Temp - Avg Temp) × Days in Month if Avg Temp < Base Temp, else 0.
Context: Used to estimate the roof's solar contribution to heating needs (DG_HEIZUNG). Higher values indicate greater heating demand (e.g., winter months).


monats_ertrag (STROMERTRAG_MONAT):

Type: Long Integer.
Unit: kWh/m²/month (kilowatt-hours per square meter per month).
Description: Monthly electrical yield from PV on the roof surface.
Calculation Method: STROMERTRAG_MONAT = MSTRAHLUNG_MONAT × 0.2 × 0.8, where:

MSTRAHLUNG_MONAT: Monthly global radiation on the roof (kWh/m²/month), adjusted for shading.
0.2: PV module efficiency (20%, updated in 2022 from 17%).
0.8: Performance ratio (80%, for system losses like inverter efficiency and soiling).


Context: Aggregates to annual yield (STROMERTRAG) and seasonal yields (STROMERTRAG_SOMMERHALBJAHR, STROMERTRAG_WINTERHALBJAHR). Supports suitability classification (EIGNUNG_DACH).



Other Technical Fields (Related Context)
The doc mentions several related fields in SOLKAT_CH_DACH_MONAT and SOLKAT_CH_DACH tables. Here's a quick overview for completeness:

mstrahlung (MSTRAHLUNG_MONAT):

Type: Long Integer.
Unit: kWh/m²/month.
Description: Monthly average global radiation on the roof surface.
Calculation: a_param * DIR + b_param * DIF + c_param, using MeteoSwiss data adjusted for roof orientation, slope, and shading (swissALTI3D, DOM, SRTM).


klasse (KLASSE):

Type: Short Integer.
Unit: None (class number).
Description: Suitability class (1 = Very Good, 2 = Good, 3 = Average, 4 = Low, 5 = Poor).
Calculation: Based on annual STROMERTRAG thresholds (e.g., >1200 kWh/m²/year = Class 1).


klasse_text (KLASSE_TEXT):

Type: String.
Unit: None.
Description: Multilingual suitability class text (e.g., "Sehr gut##Excellente##Ottimo##Very Good##...").
Calculation: Derived from KLASSE domain.


df_nummer (DF_NUMMER):

Type: Short Integer.
Unit: None.
Description: Roof surface identifier (links to SOLKAT_CH_DACH).
Calculation: Sequential number from building data (swissBUILDINGS 3D 2.0).
