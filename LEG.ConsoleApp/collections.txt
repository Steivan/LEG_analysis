  Title: Estimate of Switzerland’s Organic Soil Surface, 2025
  Description: Estimate of Switzerland’s Organic Soil Surface, 2025
The 2025 estimate of Switzerland’s organic soil surface is an update of the 2015 estimate of organic soils. As in the 2015 map, it used the approach of collating existing information sources (e.g., soil maps, geology maps, forest habitat maps, historical observations of peatlands, as well as inventories of fens and raised bogs) to generate an estimate or the current extent of organic soils. In a first step, four important data sets were updated: Soil maps, geology maps, the national inventory of raised and transitional bogs, and the forest habitat maps. In a second step, all data sets were harmonized and inserted into a data model, allowing the semi-automatic combination of the various data sets. In a third step, the data sets were combined (more specifically, overlain) and a rule-based method was used to characterise the resulting surfaces as organic soil, or not organic soil. In a fourth step, information on the mineral soil surface was used to delete surfaces for which the evidence of mineral soil was stronger. The soil surface recommended for use in most applications is 32,702 ha, which corresponds to the ‘less conservative’ estimate or organic soils.

Because of the heterogeneous nature of the information sources that were used to generate this indicator map, it is not possible to define the scale for which this map is appropriate. The following recommendation can however be made: The map is suitable for use at the regional scale (e.g., cantonal or district, ca. 1:100,000) and larger scale only; it is unsuitable for field-scale use.

The two publications (Wüst-Galley, C. and J. Leifeld (2025) “The distribution and (future) use of Switzerland’s organic soils” Mires and Peat 32(4): 1-17, DOI: 10.19189/001c.130819 and Wüst-Galley, C., A. Grünig and J. Leifeld (2015) “Locating organic soils for the greenhouse gas inventory” Agroscope Science 26, 100 pp.) describe the methodology and updated data sets in detail, and it is strongly recommended that both publications should be read by anybody wanting to use this data set.

ID: ch.agroscope.amphibien-ausbreitungskarten
  Title: Amphibien Ausbreitungskarten
  Description: Schweizweite Karten, die die Ausbreitungs-Wahrscheinlichkeiten von 11 Amphibienarten in Hektar-Auflösung darstellen. Jede Rasterzelle gibt die relative Wahrscheinlichkeit an, dass sich wandernde Individuen auf ihrem Weg zwischen bekannten Amphibienlaichgebiete durch diesen Hektar wandern. Die Karte zeigt die Ausbreitungs-Wahrscheinlichkeit, die entlang einer Skala von Blau über Gelb bis Rot zunimmt.

Diese Karten sollten als Heatmaps für die Ausbreitungsaktivität bestehender Populationen betrachtet werden. In der Praxis zeigen diese Karten auch Orte, an denen potenzielle neue Amphibienlaichgebiete die höchsten Chancen haben, besiedelt zu werden.

Gebiete mit vielen Populationen in unmittelbarer Nähe erscheinen dunkler rot, was die höhere Wahrscheinlichkeit einer Ausbreitung widerspiegelt, da sich mehrere Ausbreitungsrouten zwischen den Populationen überschneiden. Diese Eigenschaft der Karten verdient besondere Aufmerksamkeit. Hellere Schattierungen an den Rändern der Artenverbreitung bedeuten nicht unbedingt eine schwächere Verbindung zwischen den Populationen, sondern sind eher eine Folge der geringeren Dichte an Amphibienlaichgebieten an den Rändern der Verbreitung. Die Farbskala soll im Kontext der unmittelbaren Umgebung betrachtet werden.

Die Ausbreitungskarte wurde mit Circuitscape berechnet und basiert auf einer Landschaftswiderstandsmatrix, die aus dem am besten bewerteten Verbreitungsmodell für jede Art abgeleitet wurde.

ID: ch.agroscope.amphibien-bedeutung_parzellen
  Title: Agricultural parcels with potential importance to amphibians, surfaces
  Description: Switzerland-wide map of agricultural parcels that are potentially suitable as either terrestrial habitat or as part of a dispersal route between amphibian breeding sites for up to 11 amphibian species. For each agricultural parcel, the dataset contains in its attributes information on which species (if any) are found in an amphibian breeding site near the parcel (within 200 m, 500 m or 1 km) and are likely to use the parcel as terrestrial habitat. Likewise, it is indicated which species (if any) are highly likely to have dispersal routes between breeding sites that pass through the plot.
The map is based on the spatial combination of the Swiss Agricultural Parcel Map of 2021 (KGK-CGC. (2022). Agricultural Landuse 2021. https://geodienste.ch/) and suitability and dispersal maps for 11 amphibian species. The map differentiates between two-dimensional agricultural elements and overlapping elements such as trees wihch are registered as biodiversity promotion areas. Only the data set with the two-dimensional elements is available in the Federal Geodata Infrastructure.
In the default view of the map, all parcels are shown that are suitable as terrestrial habitat for at least one species with a nearby spawning site (within 500 m) and/or along a dispersal route of at least one species. By selecting a parcel, you can see which species could potentially use that parcel using the columns “species_suitXXX” and “species_corridors" (Alias: "Terrestrial habitat XXXm" and "Dispersal"), which contain a list of the Latin names of each species. 'species_suit200' is suitable habitat for a species with a breeding site within 200 m, 'species_suit500' for 500 m and 'species_suit1000' for 1000 m.

  Title: Focus map for birds of the environmental targets for agriculture
  Description: The published data were produced in the framework of Klein et al. 2025, parts of the project and co-authors were funded by Agroscope, the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) // Swiss Government under the project “ValPar.CH: Values of the ecological infrastructure in Swiss parks” (grant no. A1.2) and BiodivERsA-Belmont Forum Call on “Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem services” (grant no. BiodivScen-157). The objective of the project was to combine field-level impact of agricultural activities with the potential distribution of Swiss priority birds. The impact was assessed for 2021, using the Swiss Agricultural Life Cycle Assessment for Biodiversity (SALCA-BD, Jeanneret et al. 2014). The potential was assessed by aggregating predictions from species distribution models of 27 bird priority species, modelled as part of the ValParCH project (Adde et al. 2023), using the SWECO25 database for environmental predictors (Külling et al. 2024). First, an optimized hot spot analysis using ArcGIS pro was conducted separately on estimated impact and distribution potential. Second, they were combined using a multivariate clustering with K-means statistics to identify clusters with comparable combinations between high and low impact and high and low potential. The resulting map shows 7 clusters with distinct combinations of high/low impact and potential. The spatial resolution of the raster dataset is 25 m.

  Title: Potential corridors between protected sites for open-land wetland species (OFG-Arten)
  Description: This dataset depicts potential movement corridors between nationally and regionally inventoried wetland sites for open wetland species (OFG-Arten). This corridor raster supplements the idealized least-cost paths from the related layer, “Corridor Quality” with error bars, providing a two-dimensional representation of potential corridors around the optimal dispersal routes. Together, the two maps highlight and rank potential routes between protected wetland sites according to their permeability, allowing spatially-explicit prioritization of re-wetting initiatives.
The movement corridors were generated by buffering the least-cost paths between wetland sites in steps of 10% increases in Cost-Distance. The darkest blue corridors contain the 10% of cells with the lowest deviation in cost-distance from the least-cost path. Besides highlighting possible secondary and tertiary routes between sites, interpretation of these maps can offer useful insights regarding the local landscape and connectivity within the region. In areas where a least-cost path travels through a wide swath of wet habitat, the corridor broadens, suggesting that the least-cost path here is but one of many likely routes through the location. Alternatively, when the corridor narrows,dispersal is restricted through a thin strip of suitable habitat.

  Title: Quality of the potential corridors between protected sites for open-land wetland species (OFG-Arten)
  Description: This data set describes the quality of potential movement corridors for open wetland species (OFG species) between nationally and regionally inventoried wetlands.
This map is based on a landscape model that is categorized according to its suitability as a habitat for OFG species. Water edges and humid areas were assigned a high suitability and therefore low effort for dispersal. This suitability dataset was then used to calculate the most direct ‘least cost path’ between wetlands for the dispersal of OFG species.
The related ‘Corridor zones’ dataset supplements the idealized least-cost paths from this layer with error bars, providing spatial definition to the potential migratory routes. Together, the two maps highlight and rank potential routes between protected wetland sites according to their permeability, allowing spatially-explicit prioritization of re-wetting initiatives.
The least-cost paths are ranked according to their permeability, as measured by the total cost of movement along a path divided by the euclidean distance between the linked wetlands (Table column: 'Cost_to_EucDist_Ratio'). Red lines have a high permeability, or low cost to distance ratio, while orange lines have medium permeability, and yellow lines low. The ranking into the three categories is based on quantiles, i.e. red lines represent the 33% of least-cost-paths with the highest permeability.

  Description: The list of cities and conurbations which qualify for subsidies shows which municipalities are entitled to federal subsidies within the framework of the Urban Transport programme (in accordance with Annex 4 of the Ordinance on the Application of the Earmarked Mineral Oil Tax and other earmarked funds for traffic ([MinVV]). The basis for the list shows the definition of “Spaces with an urban character” from the Federal Statistical Office, FSO (2012). This includes the right to subsidies for all municipalities that are entitled to subsidies based on the definition of a conurbation from 2000. The number of adjoining communities are reduced in accordance with the definition by the Federal Statistical Office, FSO in 2012, through the use of statistical criteria. The municipalities of Sarnen and Appenzell as canton capitals are also included in the list of cities and conurbations which qualify for subsidies. Small adjustments were made with realignments and fillings in the gaps.

  Title: The wind energy concept – Map indicating federal government interests in the planning of wind energy plants
  Description: The wind energy concept is a concept as defined in Article 13 of the Swiss Spatial Planning Act (SPA, SR 700). The concept defines both the principal federal government interests which must be taken into account when planning wind energy plants, and the main areas with wind-power potential which must be investigated as part of cantonal structural planning. In this way, the wind energy concept increases planning reliability.
The references to federal government interests in the planning of wind energy plants are based on a synthesis of the restrictions that apply with regard to noise abatement, the federal government’s sectoral plans, measures to conserve the landscape, nature and cultural heritage and protect endangered species, as well as technical facilities which fall within the federal government’s authority. It should be noted, however, that a lack of data means that no (comprehensive) statement can be made with regard to a number of relevant federal government interests. Further examination of these federal government interests is therefore required at the appropriate level as part of cantonal structural planning and land use planning. The content of the map does not constitute any legally binding statement. Certain elements of this content are based on information which is binding on public authorities, such as assets included in federal inventories, but the map itself is not binding on any public authority.
The query function shows details of the grid cell in question. In the interests of completeness, the map and the query results must be consulted in parallel with the content of the wind energy concept and the associated explanatory report.

  Title: Housing inventory and secondary homes rate
  Description: The apartment inventory map service shows the status in blue primer of the municipalities that are subject to the building regulations of the Second Housing Act (ZWG, SR 702) and are only allowed to set up second homes under strict conditions (ZWG Art. 7ff.). The Second Homes Act defines the limit of a second home proportion at 20 per cent. The Second Homes Act obliges all Swiss municipalities to create an annual apartment inventory to calculate the number of proportion of second apartments. The basis for this is the Swiss Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings. The Swiss Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings is maintained by the municipalities and evaluated by the Federal Office for Spatial Development by 31.12. The Federal Office for Spatial Development will publish the apartment inventory and number of second apartments at the end of March. Municipalities whose second apartment share in March was under or over the limit of 20 per cent will be subject to a procedure to check the second apartment share. The list of the state of proceedings (status) will be updated at the end of October. The percentages of the apartment inventory will remain unchanged until the next publication of the apartment inventories at the end of March, as the exact values ??do not always have to be determined in the examination procedure for the decision below or above 20 percent second home share. For more precise information, the municipalities are responsible for ongoing proceedings. The municipalities have to show the total number of apartments and first apartments in the apartment inventory, however, there is no obligation to declare first apartments, equivalent apartments or second apartments as such in the RBD. Therefore, the data from the apartment inventory regarding second apartments cannot be compared with data from other municipalities.

  Title: Nature Landscape Armed Forces (NLA), natural values/ habitats on land used for military purposes
  Description: The DDPS is one of the most important landowners in Switzerland. A large part of the areas used for military purposes are within the perimeter of nature and landscape protection inventories. The military usage favours the preservation of natural values in many places, for example, in amphibian spawning sites. However, it can also have adverse effects, which should be minimised. The interests of national defence and nature conservation are of equal importance in the Federal Constitution.For 20 years, the DDPS has been protecting and promoting the diversity of species and their habitats on the army sites with the programme Nature, Landscape and the Armed Forces (NLA). As part of this programme, the natural values as well as the utilisation by the Armed Forces and by third parties have been recorded on the larger sites such as military training areas, shooting ranges and aerodromes, the conflicts identified and measures to mitigate them defined and implemented. The respective files are updated periodically or in the case of major changes. The NLA data represents the mapped valuable natural values and habitats on areas used for military purposes. Valuable refers, on the one hand, to all habitats which have a protection status. Either the habitat is protected by the NCHA or the area is in a national, cantonal or communal inventory. In addition to these protected habitats, other habitats/ areas worthy of protection are also recorded, such as species-rich areas or areas where the main purpose is to promote biodiversity.

  Title: Inventory of historical routes in Switzerland of regional and local importance
  Description: The inventory of historical routes in Switzerland (IHR) contains comprehensive information about the course of the historical routes, their history, their condition and their importance in terms of the Natural Culture and Heritage Act (NCHA). In addition to objects of national importance, which are recorded in the federal inventory (objects with visible historical substance) and as supplementary information (objects with little or no structural substance), the IHR also includes objects of regional and local importance. These objects can be identified by the cantons as being important during the cantonal legislative process, the planning process or in other appropriate ways. They can be included in the electronic publication managed by the Federal Roads Office (FEDRO), even if the cantons cannot provide a definitive designation. Until a definitive designation of this kind is supplied by the cantons, the entries are based on provisional estimates by the Swiss Confederation. The publication of these objects which have not yet been given a definitive designation by the canton in question is justified because of the importance of this for the assessment of financial aid (Article 12 of the ITRO) and interventions (Article 7 of the ITRO).

  Title: Location and surrounding areas in accordance with the Major Accidents Ordinance in the area of the motorway
  Description: The Major Accidents Ordinance (MAO, SR 814.012) aims to protect the population and the environment from severe damage caused by major accidents. It stipulates that the owners of a transport route, an enterprise, or a pipeline facility must independently implement safety measures and governs the control and assessment procedures carried out by the authorities.

The MAO applies to transit roads as defined in the Ordinance on Transit Roads, on which dangerous goods are transported or handled in accordance with the Ordinance of 17 April 1985 on the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road (SDR) or the corresponding international agreements (ADR). According to Article 1 of the Ordinance on Transit Roads, transit roads are open to general through traffic. These include motorways, expressways, and main roads.

  Title: Alpine pastures protected by livestock guardian dogs
  Description: The return of large predators to Switzerland has led to the use of livestock guardian dogs on our alpine pastures. Herd guards are used to protect livestock against larger predators (e.g., wolf, bear). The Federal Office for the Environment promotes the protection of the herds with herd protection dogs under the following conditions: the dogs must be well trained and kept (see JSV Article 10 quarter). The Confederation commissioned AGRIDEA to lead the herd protection program. At present about 200 officially recognized herd protection dogs are used in Switzerland. They are stationed on alpine pastures with a high risk of danger by large predators. The majority of the dogs are used to protect sheep and goats, while some are used to protect cow herds. Pastures protected by official herd shelters are collected in this geodataset to be visualized.

  Title: Amphibian migration conflicting with traffic
  Description: Since the mid-1950s, the number of amphibians being killed on roads has increased dramatically. Every year, hundreds of thousands of amphibians cross roads in Switzerland during their migration between land habitats and spawning grounds and are often killed on the roads if there are no protective measures in place. Not only is this a safety problem for traffic, but it is also causing massive declines in amphibian populations. Migration within populations always occurs along more or less the same migration routes. Migration is seasonal and allows temporary use of different, spatially distinct habitat types. These migration movements are essential to the survival of the populations. Info fauna karch keeps a database of conflict sites between amphibian migration and transport infrastructure. There are currently just under 2,000 known conflict sites, known as “amphibian migration sites”. Depending on the size of the amphibian population, traffic density and the possibilities on site, the protection measures included here are implemented, such as installing small animal tunnels and guiding devices, temporary amphibian fences, temporary road closures or temporary patrols. The known conflict sites of amphibian migration in Switzerland are included in this geodata set and can be visualised.

  Title: Mapping of Floodplains of National Importance
  Description: In order to give cantons the option of taking the protection of floodplains of probable national importance into their own hands as quickly as possible, the Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and Landscape had a version of detailed vegetation mappings drawn up for the cantons showing all the objects to be reviewed. In the same way, vegetation maps were subsequently drawn up for the majority of the objects that were enlarged after the consultation process. A large number of these objects, as well as all of those newly included in the inventory as part of the second and third update and the 2007 revision (without alpine floodplains) were mapped with the help of photogrammetric infra-red aerial photographs according to the same system.

  Description: The basis for establishing the biogeographical regions (in 6 or 12 classes) were the homogeneous surfaces of the river basins, where relevant and adequately extensive species information from the Info Fauna, Info Flora, Swiss Ornithological Institute and Bryophyte data centres was analysed and classified by groups of similarity. The fauna data were processed based on the Wohlgemuth method (1996), with the addition of further procedures for calculating indices of dissimilarity, species matrices and tests. The majority of the analyses were carried out with the help of the R open source software. As a first step, the results were presented in six groups, and then in twelve groups as a second step. With a few exceptions, the boundaries of catchment areas were formed: In a minority of cases, topographical criteria and expert advice were used.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Amphibian Spawning Sites of National Importance - Stationary Objects
  Description: There are currently 19 different amphibian species that live in Switzerland, and nearly all of them are included in the Red List of Threatened Species. The areas that contain wetland habitats have shrunken to less than one-tenth of their original size in the last 100 years, which is why remaining habitats must be protected. Most species prefer small still bodies of water, such as pools and ponds, for spawning. In addition to small pools and major wetland complexes, gravel and clay pits make up a large portion (approximately one-fifth of all objects) of the inventory. Due to their use, they have developed into nature-near sites that should be protected. The stationary objects are divided up into different spawning sites: Site A implies conservation sites. Site B includes narrower land habitats and buffer zones. These areas are mostly used for agriculture and forestry. Shifting spawning sites include used pits, in which the dynamic condition for conservation of future amphibian stocks should be preserved. As the fourth federal inventory under Article 18a NCHA, in 2001 the Federal Council implemented the Federal Inventory of Amphibian Spawning Sites with 701 sites. The inventory was expanded in 2003, 2007 and 2017 and now contains 929 objects.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Floodplains of National Importance
  Description: Floodplains, namely natural habitats in the flood zones of watercourses, are in decline. The scientific inventory of floodplains was commissioned by the FDHA in May 1981 and compiled by vegetation research group of the Swiss Federal Institute for Foresty (now FSL). In accordance with Article 18a of the Federal Act of 1 July 1966 on the Protec-tion of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA), which came into force on 1 February 1988, the Federal Council designates biotopes of national importance, assesses their situa-tion and sets conservation objectives for them. However, this occurs after the cantons have been heard. As the second federal inventory under Article 18a NCHA, in 1992 the Federal Council implemented the Federal Inventory of Floodplains with 169 floodplain sites. It has been expanded in 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2017. Between 1995 and 1997, the Inventory of Glacier Forelands and Alpine Floodplains (IGLES), a scientific inventory, developed the bases for the first expansion. Currently 326 objects are contained in the inventory and protected by law.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments
  Description: Article 5 of the Federal Act of 1 July 1966 on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA) orders the Federal Council to compile inventories of sites of national importance (federal inventories). The cantons must be heard when these inventories are enacted. The Federal Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments of National Importance (ILNM) is the first federal inventory under the NCHA. The preliminary stage is the CLN Inventory (Inventory of Landscapes and Natural Monuments of National Importance), a reference whose first edition was released by private organizations in 1963 and has been periodically expanded and revised. The ILNM inventory has gradually taken legal effect. To date, the Federal Council has approved four inventory development series: the first series in 1977 with 65 sites; the second series in 1983 with 54 sites; the third series in 1996 with 33 sites and 11 revised sites; and the fourth series in 1998 with 9 sites and 15 revised sites. In the 2017 revision a surface exchange between the objects 1605 and 1606 was made.

  Description: Fens are vestiges of earlier natural and cultural landscapes and are in sharp decline. They are home to highly-adapted symbiotic communities of plants and animals that include a large number of endangered plant and animal species. The scientific fen inventory was conducted from 1987 to 90 by a work group on behalf of the FDHA. Under Art. 18a of Article 18a of the Federal Act of 1 Juli 1966 on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA), the Federal Council designates the biotopes of national importance, assesses their situation and sets conservation objectives for them. However, this occurs only after the cantons have been heard. In 1994, the Federal Council implemented the Fen Ordinance with the federal inventory, whose first series contained 728 sites. Its second series with 364 sites followed in 1997, and the third and final series with 71 sites in 1998. Some of the sites were revised in 2001, 2004, 2007, 2017 and 2021. The inventory now contains 1333 Objects.

  Description: Raised bogs are some of the most susceptible habitats in Switzerland and are in sharp decline. Today, between 10% and 20% of the original stocks still exist. The scientific inventory of raised bogs was compiled from 1978 to 1984 by the Agricultural Division of the WSL (Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research) on behalf of Pro Natura Helvetica. Under Article 18a of the Federal Act of 1 July 1966 on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA), which came into force in 1 February 1988, the Federal Council designates the biotopes of national importance, assesses their situation and sets conservation objectives for them. However, this occurs only after the cantons have been heard. As the first federal inventory under Art. 18a NCHA, the Federal Council implemented the raised and transition bog inventory with 514 sites in 1991. It was expanded in 2003 by a second series and revised in 2007 and 2017. It now has 551 sites.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Hunting Ban Reserves
  Description: Federal hunting bans have existed since 1875 and served the purpose of raising the populations of chamois, red deer and roe deer as well as ibex (cloven-hoofed game), which had become rare at that time due to persecution by hunting and competition from cattle. The present situation is characterized by high and partly overshot populations of cloven-hoofed game with the resulting game damage problems on the one hand, and by the decline of sensitive species such as capercaillie, rock partridge, grey partridge and brown hare on the other. On April 1, 1988, the Federal Law on Hunting and the Protection of Wild Mammals and Birds (NHG, June 20, 1986) came into force. This also marked the beginning of the revision of the Ordinance on Banned Areas, which dates back to 1962. Today, these are aimed at regulating the populations of deer, roe deer, chamois and ibex, as well as protecting and promoting rare species and their habitats. The inventory contains 43 objects, some of which have been slightly modified since 1992. One object is added is 2023.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Mire Landscapes of Particular Beauty and National Significance
  Description: Mire landscapes are essentially semi-natural landscapes shaped by mires that are also home to other noteworthy natural and cultural elements. They are the last remaining habitats for various animal and plant species. The scientific mire landscape inventory was compiled from 1987 to 1990 by Hintermann & Weber AG on behalf of the FDHA. Under Art. 23b of the Federal Act of 1 July 1966 on the Protection of Nature and Cultural Heritage (NCHA), the Federal Council designates the mire landscapes of particular beauty and national importance in consideration of existing settlements and uses and assesses their situation. It also works closely with the cantons and hears the property owners concerned. In 1996, the Federal Council enacted the protection of mire landscapes provision that contained an appendix with a federal inventory of 88 sites. It was first revised in 2001 at the request of the Canton of Vaud, followed by a second revision that including the definitive entry of the Grimsel site in 2004, and two other revisions in 2007, 2015 and 2017. It counts now 89 sites.

  Title: Federal Inventory of Reserves for Waterbirds and Migratory Birds of international and national importance
  Description: Switzerland is especially important as a wintering and resting site for various migratory waterbirds. As a result, in 1974 the Federal Council signed a convention on watercourses and wetlands of international importance that was concluded in 1971 in Ramsar (Ramsar Convention). It was ratified by the Federal Parliament in 1975. An inventory of waterbird reserves of international importance was developed for Switzerland in 1976 based on earlier criteria. The Swiss Ornithological Institution in Sempach submitted the second revised version of this inventory in 1995, which included reserves of national importance. Under Article 11 of the new Federal Act of 20 June 1986 on the Hunting and Protection of Wild Mammals and Birds (HuntA), the federal government is required to exclude reserves of waterbirds and migratory birds of international importance. After being revised in 1992, 2001, 2009, 2015 and 2023, the current inventory contains the most important sites included in the inventory of the Swiss Ornithological Institute, of which 10 are of international importance and 25 are of national importance.

  Title: Monthly soil erosion risk maps for Swiss permanent grassland, with average soil loss in tons/(ha*month) - overview
  Description: Monthly soil erosion risk maps for Swiss permanent grassland with a spatial resolution of 100m. The maps show the average soil loss in tons per hectare and month. Shades of green, yellow and red mean a low, average and high risk of erosion, respectively.The monthly soil erosion risk maps were calculated using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). For this RUSLE application, the monthly dynamic of the rainfall erosivity factor (R-factor) and cover and management factor (C-factor) was considered as follows: A(month)= R(month)*K*C(month)*L*S*P where A(month) is the soil loss in tons per hectare and month and R(month) and C(month) are the monthly R-factor (MJ mm ha?¹ h?¹ month?¹) and C-factor (dimensionless). The other erosion factors are soil erodibility (K-factor), slope length (L-factor), slope steepness (S-factor) and support practices (P-factor). The RUSLE factors were tailored to the specific environmental conditions of Swiss permanent grassland. The P-factor was included in the calculation as a constant with value 1 due to a lack of spatial information on grazing management and its effect on soil erosion.

  Title: Distribution of ibex colonies
  Description: After being resettled in 1906, Alpine (Capra) ibex live in colonies of varying sizes throughout the Alpine region and in the Jura mountains. Because the growth of stocks in specific colonies had negative effects on other species and vegetation, regulatory measures were taken. The regulations concerning the hunting quota for ibex stocks are based on the Federal Act of 20 June 1986 on the Hunting and Protection of Wild Mammals and Birds. The colonies are counted in accordance with the provisions on stocktaking of the Ordinance of 30 April 1990 on the Regulation of Capra Stocks, which is used in addition to stocktaking to set hunting quotas.

  Title: Overland flow map
  Description: The areas affected by overland flow were determined using a simplified method the over entire Switzerland and Liechtenstein. They were determined by modelling without any verification in the field. The map shows areas that are potentially affected by rare to very rare events. It provides a rough overview of the hazard of overland flow. It does neither take into account flooding due to overflowing watercourses, nor due to protective structures or culverts under roads or embankments (e.g. railway embankment appear according to the DTM as dykes without vaults). This map allows - in the absence of a more detailed hazard map - a rough assessment of the hazardous overland flow. The return period of the event represented is estimated to be larger than 100 years - an event that, over a long period of observation, would appear on average once every 100 years. It cannot be ruled out that areas not affected by the hazard map may be affected. It has to be used on a scale coarser than 1: 12,500 (Liechtenstein: 1:10,000) because of the potential for misinterpretation of affected and unaffected areas respectively. The map is not legally binding. The cantons are free to use it as an indicative hazard map and publish it on their cantonal geoportals.

  Title: Map of seismic subsoil categories according to the standard SIA 261
  Description: The site class is a required indication to determine the seismic action for a structure according to the building code SIA 261. The maps of site classes are indicative maps and are not parcel-specific. In case of uncertainties, the site class is mapped on the safe side. The maps are primarily useful in the context of preliminary studies. When planning construction projects, the plausibility of the site class must be verified on the basis of local studies. In case of differences, the site class based on local investigations should be used. The maps of seismic site classes are prepared and updated by the cantons on their own initiative based on the methodological guidelines of the FOEN. In agreement with the cantons FOEN makes these maps available centrally. Any requests for corrections or comments must be addressed to the respective cantons, except for the city of Bern and the St-Galler Rheintal (FOEN pilot maps). * Most maps are based on the description of the site classes of the SIA 261 building code, 2003 edition. This description was adapted in 2014. Differences in the description of the site classes between the currently valid building code SIA 261:2020 and the 2003 edition must therefore be taken into account. The reference building code (SIA261:2003 or SIA 261:2020) for mapping is given in the object information.

  Title: Perimeters of existing spectral micro-zoning studies
  Description: Perimeters for which a spectral seismic micro-zonation study is available with links to further information. The amplification of seismic waves through the local geology is modeled in a seismic spectral micro-zoning study. Local seismic amplification functions and response spectrums are determined as a result. These response spectrums can be used to determine the earthquake loads on buildings instead of the response spectrums of standard SIA 261.

  Description: Interpolierte Antimon-Konzentrationen (mg/kg Feinerde) in den Oberböden (0–20 cm) der Schweiz. Für die Ordinary Kriging Interpolationen (1 km x 1 km) wurden Messdaten von insgesamt 1'201 Standorten des Biodiversitätsmonitorings Schweiz, der Nationalen Bodenbeobachtung und des europäischen geochemischen Bodenatlas berücksichtigt. Die Element-Konzentrationen wurden in Königswasser Aufschlüssen (HNO?:HCl:H?O) von getrockneten (40°C), gesiebten (< 2 mm) und anschliessend gemahlenen Bodenproben mittels induktiv gekoppelter Plasma Massenspektrometrie analysiert. Standorte mit bekannter anthropogener Überprägung der Element-Konzentrationen (Punktquellen) wurden vorgängig ausgeschlossen. Bei den Ergebnissen des geochemischen Bodenatlas handelt es sich um eine Momentaufnahme der Element-Konzentrationen in den Oberböden der Schweiz (Probenahmezeitraum 2011–2015). Die interpolierten Karten dienen der verbesserten Visualisierung von Regionen mit erhöhten resp. tiefen Konzentrationen. Es können daraus jedoch keine parzellenscharfen Informationen oder definitive Rückschlüsse auf die Geologie, die Bioverfügbarkeit, die prozentualen Verteilung der geogenen und anthropogenen Quellen sowie die Belastung des Bodens abgeleitet werden.

  Title: Geochemical soil atlas of Switzerland: Magnesium
  Description: Interpolated element concentrations (mg/kg fine soil) in the topsoil (0-20 cm) of Switzerland. For the Ordinary Kriging interpolations (1 km x 1 km), measurement data from a total of 1,201 sites of the Swiss Biodiversity Monitoring, the National Soil Monitoring and the European Geochemical Soil Atlas were taken into account. The element concentrations were analyzed in aqua regia digests (HNO?:HCl:H?O) of dried (40°C), sieved (< 2 mm) and subsequently ground soil samples using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Sites with known anthropogenic overprinting of element concentrations (point sources) were excluded in advance. The results of the geochemical soil atlas are a snapshot of the element concentrations in the topsoils of Switzerland (sampling period 2011-2015). The interpolated maps serve to improve the visualization of regions with elevated or low concentrations. However, no plot-specific information or definitive conclusions on the geology, bioavailability, percentage distribution of geogenic and anthropogenic sources or soil contamination can be derived from them.
